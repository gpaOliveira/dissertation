abstract={This paper focuses on improving requirements quality in agile projects by determining requirements prioritization. Current methods suggest to take into account business value in order to determine the requirements priority rank. In practice it was observed that many other factors enter into the equation, such as implementation cost and functionality dependencies. Since agile methods suggest that priority should be customer/user's prerogative, taking all relevant factors becomes challenging without decision supporting tools. Our research question is the following: How can we formulate the agile release decision problem, and which computations can we do over requirements models to recommend solutions to that decision problem? Our contributions are the following: (i) we formulate this agile release decision problem as an optimization problem, (ii) we provide a modelling language to represent instances of this problem as requirements models, and (iii) we describe an online tool to make the models and solve the resulting optimization problem instances.},

pages={199-204}, 
abstract={Requirements Engineering establishes the process for defining requirements as one in which elicitation, modeling and analysis are tasks which must be carried out. This process should involve different stakeholders and their different viewpoints. Among these stakeholders, there is the software designer, responsible for creating models based on the information gathered by business specialists. However, this communication channel may create some "noise" that leads to information being lost. This loss produces a semantic gap between what is desired and what will be developed. The semantic gap is characterized by inconsistencies in the requirements represented by scenarios -- user stories in a behavior-driven context -- and by the conceptual model. This paper presents an interactive approach to the agile requirements modeling, thus fostering greater consistency between the artifacts of the scenarios and the conceptual model. This consistency is ensured by using a mind model specification which will serve as a basis for transforming the definitions of the scenario and generating a conceptual model represented by a UML class diagram. The mind model represents the main role of this approach, and functions as a bond that represents the business entities, thus enabling the requirements to be more consistent with the reality of the business.},

abstract={Traditionally the flow of authoritative information and control in requirements and software engineering is from requirements to architecture, design, development, implementation and testing. Iterative, spiral and agile methods, among others, have introduced increments and iterations in eliciting and discovering requirements within the project life cycle. Yet the authoritative flow of information across organizational boundaries within the enterprise continues to be from requirements to architecture to design. We argue that two additional implicit sources of information should be included in the requirements engineering process, contextual environment concerns and architectural patterns and heuristics. To account for these two sources of implicit requirements information we introduce the concept of forward and backward inferred macro-architectural requirements. Forward inferred macro-architectural requirements are elicited from contextual environment concerns. Backward inferred macro-architectural requirements are extracted through a reverse requirements elicitation process from architectural heuristics and patterns. We have observed significant improvements in the efficiency of the development processes and the quality of the final software products as a result of making inferred macro-architectural requirements explicit.},

Virtual enterprise as the important framework of agile manufacturing system has become the main evolvement goal of manufacturing enterprises. Virtual enterprise comprises several member enterprises, so virtual enterprise can eliminate the restriction of technology and resources in the independent enterprise. Manufacture efficiency and quality of product can be enhanced. Obviously, the product development management is a very important task of virtual enterprise. Authors put forward applying the Unified Modeling Language to establishing the visual model of product development management in virtual enterprise. Moreover, authors set forth the detailed modeling methods and processes of use case diagram, activity diagram, sequence diagram and collaboration diagram. Then the visual model can be integrated with the diagrams. According to the visual model, the product development management in virtual enterprise can be arranged rationally, and then the manufacture efficiency can be enhanced markedly.},

pages={293-302}, 
abstract={Any reasonable implementation of privacy requirements can not be made through legal compliance alone. The belief that a software system can be developed without privacy being an integral concept, or that a privacy policy is sufficient as requirements or compliance check is at best dangerous for the users, customers and business involved. While requirements frameworks exist, the specialisation of these into the privacy domain have not been made in such a manner that they unify both the legal and engineering domains. In order to achieve this one must develop ontological structures to aid communication between these domains, provide a commonly acceptable semantics and a framework by which requirements expressed at different levels of abstractness can be linked together and support refinement. An effect of this is to almost completely remove the terms 'personal data' and 'PII' from common usage and force a deeper understanding of the data and information being processed. Once such a structure is in place - even if just partially or sparsely populated - provides a formal framework by which not only requirements can be obtained, their application (or not) be justified and a proper risk analysis made. This has further advantages in that privacy requirements and their potential implementations can be explored through the software development process and support ideas such as agile methods and 'DevOps' rather than being an 'add-on' exercise - a privacy impact assessment - poorly executed at inappropriate times.},

abstract={Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are quality attributes that define how a software product will do its functions. They are important and critical to the success of any software in the market as they considered as the differentiating factor from other software products that provide similar functionality. Agile methodology became popular during the last few years, and although it improves the process of software development, it has a number of limitations regarding requirements analysis. Neglecting the non-functional requirements is one of the biggest limitations in Agile. It doesn't provide any widely accepted technique for elicitation and management of non-functional requirements. This paper summarizes two existing approaches that are currently used to analysis NFRs, and then it provides an enhanced approach for better analysis of NFRs. The new approach is better than the existing ones, because it combines their strengths and overcome their weaknesses.},

abstract={User stories are a widely used notation for formulating requirements in agile development projects. Despite their popularity in industry, little to no academic work is available on assessing their quality. The few existing approaches are too generic or employ highly qualitative metrics. We propose the Quality User Story Framework, consisting of 14 quality criteria that user story writers should strive to conform to. Additionally, we introduce the conceptual model of a user story, which we rely on to design the AQUSA software tool. AQUSA aids requirements engineers in turning raw user stories into higher-quality ones by exposing defects and deviations from good practice in user stories. We evaluate our work by applying the framework and a prototype implementation to three user story sets from industry.},

title={Approximation of COSMIC Functional Size of Scenario-Based Requirements in Agile Based on Syntactic Linguistic Features #x2014;A Replication Study}, 
year={2016}, 
pages={201-211}, 
abstract={Context: Expert judgment is the most frequently used method of effort estimation in Agile software development. Unfortunately, Agile teams often underestimate development effort. Therefore, it seems beneficial to support such teams with the information regarding the functional size of requirements they are estimating. Hussain, Kosseim and Ormandjieva (HKO) proposed a method that can be used to automatically classify textual requirements with respect to their COSMIC functional size. Unfortunately, the method has not been sufficiently validated to confirm its usefulness. Objective: To provide external validation of the HKO method and investigate if it can be applied to classify scenario-based requirements (in the form of use cases) with respect to their COSMIC size. Method: Similarily to the original study, we used a set of natural language processing tools to extract syntactic linguistic features and the C4.5 decision tree-based classifiers to classify requirements. We validated the performance of the classifiers using the 10-fold cross-validation procedure on a dataset containing 93 use cases. We compared the performance of the HKO method with the performance of the classifiers trained using a single prediction feature—the number of steps in a use case. Results: Depending on the considered number of size classes and the algorithm used to compute boundaries of the classes, the accuracy of the HKO method ranged between .387 and .785 while the Cohen's kappa index was between .194 and .577. The accuracy of the use-case-steps-based classifiers performed slightly worse. Their accuracy ranged between .015 and .769 while Cohen's kappa was between .067 and .423. We observed that the performance of both types of classifiers dropped visibly when applied to four or more size classes. Conclusion: The classification performance of the HKO method was moderate. However, it was still better than the classification based on the number of steps. Unfortunately, we- also observed that the accuracy of the HKO method is sensitive to the language used in descriptions of requirements.},

year={2014},

abstract={Agile methodologies use user stories to capture software requirements. This often results in team members over emphasizing their understanding of the goals, without proper incorporation of goals from other stakeholders or customers. Existing UML or other goal oriented modeling methods tend to be overly complex for non-technical stakeholders to properly express their goals and communicate them to the agile team. In this paper, we propose a light weight Goal Net based method to model goal requirements in agile software development process to address this problem. It can be used to decompose complex processes into phased goals, and model low level user stories to high level hierarchy goal structures. Our preliminary analysis and studies in educational software engineering contexts show that it can improve agile team's group awareness to project goals and, thus, improve team productivity and artifact quality. The proposed approach was evaluated in university level agile software engineering projects. It has achieved an improvement of over 50 percentage points in terms of the proportion of high quality user stories generated by students compared to the standard user story template used in Scrum.},

year={2012}, 
pages={161-164}, 
abstract={The customer, a leading Global Telecommunication and Service Provider, has made the strategical decision to move away from the old fashioned Telecommunication company to a more internet player oriented service provider. The approach is to combine the short time-to-market requirement, like a state-of-the-art internet player uses to follow with a more mature way of delivering services. This combination made it necessary to implement new ways of probing customers' reaction on newly planned mobile services. The question "how satisfied will customers be with the service currently being developed" wasn't affordable to be answered 6 months or more after project initiation. A permanent "pulse monitoring" of customers' needs and understanding of these was mandatory to be implemented to react within short timeframes on changes on the market. As a consequence the existing Quality Management process framework needed to be adapted as well. As a tool to probe customer satisfaction the KANO model (see [1]) was introduced. A tailored adaptation of the standard KANO approach was implemented with low effort and costs. At different stages in the service delivery lifecycle KANO surveys were conducted encompassing features on use case levels, supported by early prototypes whenever feasible, conducted with real customers, friendly users or project team members. It can be clearly shown with the help of some real life examples that the new approach added value by focusing efforts in service design, development and verification stages while at the same time increasing the ownership and commitment for the end customer product.},

Requirements are considered the basis of any software project. Therefore, any ambiguity in natural language requirements leads to major errors in the coming phases. Moreover, poorly defined requirements may cause software project failure. There exist many software development models as waterfall model, agile model, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel automated approach to generate test cases from requirements. Requirements can be gathered from different models either waterfall model (functional and non-functional) or agile model. SRS documents, non-functional requirements and user stories are parsed and used by the proposed approach to generate test cases in which requirements with different types are covered. The proposed approach uses text mining and symbolic execution methodology for test data generation and validation, where a knowledge base is developed for multi-disciplinary domains.},

title={Evaluating a Fractionated Spacecraft system: A business case tool for DARPA's F6 program}, 
year={2012}, 
pages={1-20}, 
abstract={The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has recently begun an effort to further refine its Fractionated Spacecraft vision. This vision (called the "F6" program) seeks to explore distributed spacecraft architectures capable of performing complex functions similar to current monolithic spacecrafts. However, the ability of fractionated systems to work separately would provide significant benefits not achievable by monolithic systems. The question of interest to this study was "Can these benefits be quantified and evaluated in a meaningful fashion in order to compare them to monolithic architectures?" Rather than narrowing the approach to one or two concepts, the strategy was to expand the decision space in order to generate and evaluate a variety of alternatives under different scenarios and design choices. The stimuli were specifically selected to capture many issues not included in such studies such as technology obsolescence, funding profile changes, equipment failure scenarios, and even changes to mission objectives during the mission. Each stimulus has a variety of decision options or responses which a manager can exercise including delay, cancellation, acceleration of a development, or even new developments. It is argued that the very nature of fractionation will result in systems far more agile to external (and internal) stimuli, but this has never been shown explicitly. This study explores the use of Real Options in conjunction with traditional Net Present Value techniques to quantify the desirability of alternative candidate designs in terms of their adaptability and survivability. Our approach to evaluating the business case for each use case was to explicitly model both the implementation and operation phases for the life cycle of a fractionated cluster. The models were integrated into Phoenix Integration's ModelCenter® framework and used to generate Implementation Value Metrics (IVMs) and Operational Value Metrics (OVMs) associated w- th the use cases under evaluation. A number of models were developed to support these evaluations using Excel, Matlab, and Arena® (a commercial discrete-event simulation software product). The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) approach used in this study yielded transformations between high-level frameworks (OWL and SysML) and the models used to generate the data we needed for the evaluation. This rule-based transformation process will be critical for exploring the large decision trade spaces in a reasonable amount of time. This paper presents the results of the business case analyses; the underlying OVM's and IVM's, the approaches used to model the problem, explore the tradespace, refine the exploration, and generate results. We also discuss possible directions for future work. Specifically, it should be noted that while the approach described herein is being developed for, and funded by, DARPA, it has general applicability to a much wider variety of applications.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the importance of test driven development, in an interdisciplinary academic case study, involving unauthorized access and fraud. In it, Problem Based Learning (PBL) enabled the organization of an environment for diverse knowledge and skills, favorable to experimentation and prototyping of new models, methods, techniques, and tools. The application of the principles of agile methods aimed at overcoming difficulties related to the computer systems development, such as requirement changes, uncertainties, and risks, in order to improve quality. Unlike traditional methodologies, tests were used since the beginning of the development lifecycle with Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). The agile testing quadrants guided the categorized elaboration of tests during unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing phases. The main contribution of this article was the integrated application of PBL, ATDD, and agile development in the case study of a Real-Time Embedded System for Unauthorized Access Control and Fraud Detection (Sistema Embarcado de Tempo Real para Controle de Acessos Indevidos e Deteccao de Fraudes - SETRAIF).},

abstract={Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) are increasingly deployed to achieve distributed systems that are modular, flexible and extensible. Designing for a SOA can be difficult, however. There are issues involving the granularity of the cooperating services, and there are no currently accepted conventions for describing a service or its interactions at an abstract level. This paper presents the Service Responsibility and Interaction Design Method (SRI-DM), an agile approach for engineering a Web Service design, based on capturing a scenario as a use-case, factoring this into a set of Service Responsibility and Collaboration Cards, and constructing a Sequence diagram illustrating their interactions in fulfilling the scenario. The paper presents the notation for each step and describes with the aid of an example how this process is used to create a service design within the domain of e-assessment.},

abstract={The functional test-driven development (FTDD) cycle moves functional test specification to the earliest part of the software development life cycle. Functional tests no longer merely assess quality; their purpose now is to drive quality. For some agile processes such as extreme programming, functional tests are the primary requirements specification artifact. When functional tests serve as both the system specification and the automated regression test safety net, they must remain viable for the production code's lifetime. A successful functional test-driven development strategy relies on effective fools across the application life cycle. This article reflects on FTDD teams' core tasks performed over the full application life cycle. It then envisions a conceptual functional testing framework and a concrete list of capabilities that satisfy these needs},

abstract={Agile and lean software development methodologies appear as a popular alternative to plan-driven methodologies, but these methodologies have no structure in the process of user requirements specification. This paper shows how Method for Elicitation, Documentation and Validation of Software User Requirements (MEDoV) supports agile and lean software development methodologies. The MEDoV helps stakeholders in their everyday work with minimal impact on agility. The method also ensures an active role of business users, a wide-picture what usually is the problem for agile development, and definition of non-functional requirements, what the even bigger problem is. The MEDoV ensures that no unnecessary features are produced so that no extra code is created, and maintenance is easier, as well as code correction and improvement. Using models enables agility in product maintenance, especially for integrated systems where one change can have multiple impacts on different parts of system.},

abstract={The modularity and customer centric approach of use cases make them the preferred methods for requirement elicitation, especially in iterative software development processes as in agile programming. Numerous guidelines exist for use case style and content, but enforcing compliance to such guidelines in the industry currently requires specialized training and a strongly managed requirement elicitation process. However, often due to aggressive development schedules, organizations shy away from such extensive processes and end up capturing use cases in an ad-hoc fashion with little guidance. This results in poor quality use cases that are seldom fit for any downstream software activities. We have developed an approach for automated and "edit-time" inspection of use cases based on the construction and analysis of models of use cases. Our models contain linguistic properties of the use case text along with the functional properties of the system under discussion. In this paper, we present a suite of model analysis techniques that leverage such models to validate uses cases simultaneously for their style and content. Such model analysis techniques can be combined with a robust NLP techniques to develop integrated development environments for use case authoring, as we do in Text2Test. When used in an industrial setting, Text2Test resulted in better compliance of use cases, in enhanced productivity and, subsequently, in higher quality of test cases.},

Security has been addressed by isolated security assurance practices, some of which consider risks and mitigations but they do not provide an overview of the overall security state of the system being developed. This paper takes the position that (1) these isolated security assurance practices should be fully integrated and should be embedded in short iterations of risk assessment, treatment and acceptance, providing input for updating security requirements and for security risk management, and that (2) available empirical data from public catalogs and databases should be used as a source of expertise, to leverage past experiences, and therefore reduce, although not eliminate, subjectivity of human judgment. Borrowing from the agile software development and project management philosophy, we introduce the idea of a light weight, agile approach to security risk management integrated to the development life cycle.},

abstract={The rise of agile software development methods has led to the abandonment of many traditional practices especially in requirements engineering (RE). Agile RE is still a relatively new research area and the growing use of agile methods in large projects is forcing companies to look for more formal practices for RE. This paper describes experiences gained from a case study of a large agile project. The goal of this case study was to explore how prototyping can solve the challenges of agile RE. Our findings indicate that while prototyping can help with some challenges of agile RE such as lack of documentation, motivation for RE work and poor quality communication, it also needs complementary practices to reach its full potential. These practices include reviewing the big picture regularly, keeping track of quality requirements, and using ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development).},

abstract={Two fundamental principles and values of agile methods are customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software and the improvement of the communication process by continuous stakeholders' involvement. But, how to deal with customers' satisfaction and find a better visualization model at the requirements level (which stakeholders can understand and be involved) in an agile development context? Also, how this visualization model enhancement can guarantee consistency between agile requirements artefacts (e.g., user stories and domain models)? Thus, to answer these questions, this paper presents the SnapMind framework. This framework aims to make the requirements modelling process more user-centered, through the definition of a visual requirements language, based on mind maps, model-driven and domain specific language techniques. Moreover, through these techniques, the SnapMind framework focuses on support for consistency between user stories and the domain models using a model animation technique called snapshots. The framework was applied to an industrial case study to investigate its feasibility.},

abstract={Agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, have gained tremendous popularity and proven successful in quickly delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile methodologies have not adequately modeled Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and their potential solutions (operationalizations) with FRs in early development phases. This research proposes three fundamental agile artifacts to model FRs, NFRs, and their potential solutions in a visual environment. First, FRs are modeled through Agile Use Cases (AUCs). Second, NFRs are modeled through Agile Loose Cases (ALCs). Third, NFRs potential solutions are modeled through Agile Choose Cases (ACCs). AUCs are newly proposed hybrid of use cases and agile user stories. ALCs are proposed loosely-defined agile NFRs. ACCs are proposed potential solutions (operationalizations) for ALCs. The three artifacts are combined in a visual framework to promote agile modeling of NFRs (primarily) and how they are linked to FRs. The artifacts are the building blocks of a more comprehensive framework for modeling NFRs in agile software development processes.},

abstract={The requirements engineering (RE) processes used at Hewlett-Packard (HP) are many and varied. They range from informal to formal on projects that are short, agile, and at Internet-speed as well as long and methodical ones. Typically, the RE approach is influenced by business drivers as well as constraints or attributes of the project. Some of the major attributes that affect HP's RE selection process include: level of understanding of the user's domain/needs, project size and complexity, schedule, resources, cost, quality expectations, project personnel expertise, development model (in-house versus outsourced), tolerance for requirements volatility, cost of requirements changes during development and after release, and the speed at which changes can be applied to the product after release. Attributes of the RE approach for two HP projects are examined in This work. The first project is agile with an Internet-speed release schedule. It is based on experience with the Web site and consumer award-winning eservices hpshopping.com organization. The other project is large, complex, and makes use of outsourced development. It is based on experience with the development of an HP worldwide (WW) IT customer communications system that cuts across all of HP's businesses. Many different RE processes are used at HP. The most effective ones are those customized to closely fit the business drivers and project attributes.},

abstract={Power and resource management are key goals for the success of modern battery-supplied multimedia devices, which are complex systems with multiple functionalities all embedded in a small set of components. This kind of devices are usually based on SoCs with a wide range of subsystems, that compete in the usage of shared resources and offer several power saving capabilities, but need an adequate software support to exploit such capabilities. Therefore, offering the best QoS level and user experience, while saving as much power as possible to improve mobility becomes a challenging goal that involves all the layers of a system, from the application level to the device driver's level. Moreover, reduced time to market in the development of new products require the definition of an agile methodology that permit portability of existing solutions and code across different devices and new products' versions. The goal of CPM is to permit coordination and communication between different entities of the system to grant the desired QoS using dynamic optimization policies with negligible impact on the system. We focus on a real use case which shows the benefits of CPM both on resources management and on the solution of a dependency issue on the clock frequency of hardware devices (CPU and DSPs) in a SoC.},

abstract={Product development processes and best practices have come a long way in the last decade through continuous evolutions of new lifecycle and process models. Development models such as the waterfall model, spiral model, rational unified process, agile and many others have looked at efficiency of the development processes. These approaches have helped practitioners improve immensely on the efficiency and efficacy of the product development processes. However, product quality needs to be measured by parameters that go beyond the traditional criteria like performance, reliability, reusability etc. A product that has any interaction with the end user also needs to meet a fundamental requirement of being “user friendly”. Development models such as JAD (Joint Application Development) have focused on making products user friendly. Apart from achieving the technical soundness in a product, the success of the product also largely depends on how well the product addresses the primary requirements of the user such as desirability, relevance and usability. Not meeting these requirements leads to bad user experience, which, in turn can actually lead to failure of the product. This paper discusses some of the misconceptions and myths that exist in the industry regarding Requirements Engineering (RE) and User Experience Design (UXD), and how user needs typically slip through the cracks under the name of “non functional requirements”. The paper highlights the need for RE and UXD focus during the overall product development life cycle. In the concluding section an integrated framework for RE and UXD in the PLM process is presented.},

abstract={The paper is an editorial on software architecture. Software projects fail for the same reasons. The mistakes that can lead software projects to trouble before concrete architecture elaboration even begins include missing, wrong, or creeping system scope; and vague, unnecessary, or extreme nonfunctional requirements. These mistakes aren't the prime responsibility of architects, but architects are directly affected if they occur because without an appropriate system scope and correspondingly appropriate requirements, they can't define sustainable architectures. A system's scope defines its responsibilities, but also its boundaries. Failing to define a precise system scope can result in architectures that support the wrong functionality, too much functionality, too many functionality variations, too few functions, or poor quality. Architects should pay special attention to nonfunctional requirements that too often include vague or unnecessarily extreme specifications. Without precision, architects must guess which nonfunctional qualities are actually needed, and if they must guess, they'll likely guess wrong. An agile, incremental approach to software development define an initial system scope and set of requirements in a reasonable time and adjust this big picture step-wise until it has enough focus, substance, and clarity. Then, architects get concrete guidance for their work and can act rather than react when designing the system's architecture. Only then do architects receive a safety network that allows them to identify and correct design flaws in their own area of responsibility.},

pages={97-105}, 
abstract={NGSON is an IEEE sponsored effort to standardize an open service ecosystem where different stakeholders may cooperate to satisfy users' ever changing requirements by composing and delivering services dynamically across different service providers and network operators' domains. A main distinguishing feature of NGSON is context awareness, that is, the capability of collecting, processing, and using context information to drive the interactions of the NGSON overlay nodes with service and network operators' infrastructures for guaranteeing an optimal user experience. Recent advances in network control and management technologies, such as SDN, NFV, and service-oriented networking paradigms, are expected to make the network effectively able to cope with application service requirements in a more flexible, timely, and agile manner. In this article we discuss how NGSON, which already incorporates several aspects of virtualization, could take advantage of network virtualization mechanisms and programmable traffic steering capabilities to enhance and effectively support context-aware service composition along with adaptive service delivery. We propose an architectural model for NGSON that leverages these novel network service control capabilities and illustrate through a use case how this model could effectively be put into operation.},

abstract={The activity of validating identified requirements for an information system helps to improve the quality of a requirements specification document and, consequently, the success of a project. Although various different support tools to requirements engineering exist in the market, there is still a lack of automated support for validation activity. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to make up for that deficiency, with the use of an automated tool, to provide the resources for the execution of an adequate validation activity. The contribution of this study is to enable an agile and effective follow-up of the scope established for the requirements, so as to lead the development to a solution which would satisfy the real necessities of the users, as well as to supply project managers with relevant information about the maturity of the analysts involved in requirements specification.},

year={2007}, 
pages={246-254}, 
abstract={One of the problems associated with complex systems engineering is identifying the system knowledge relevant to build system implementation. System operations are an essential part of this knowledge. Software and system engineering standards highlight the importance of system operations; templates for a concept of operations document are available from different standard bodies in the context of requirements engineering and specification. However, specific guidelines for operations modeling are not usually provided. This paper introduces an approach to systematically model system operations. The cornerstone for this is an operations metamodel; this metamodel is presented within this paper and has been defined using UML 2.x. The baseline for the metamodel is a schema, also introduced within the paper, which formalizes system operations in terms of commands acting on systems, inputs to the system, and different kinds of outputs classified into responses, notifications and alarms. Operations models, as presented here, comprise system knowledge essentials from a functional point of view but reduced in size compared to the whole system specification. They can be deployed in several ways; this paper presents their use as drivers for system development and validation from early lifecycle stages.},

year={2014}, 
pages={222-232}, 
abstract={Software development organizations applying continuous process improvement, when faced with the limits of qualitative approaches, are looking into quantitative approaches to support decision making, namely for improvement of the software project estimation process. Quantitative approaches include sizing functional requirements with standards such as ISO 19761, known as the COSMIC method. But defects in the requirements may have an impact on the accuracy of the resulting functional size, as well as an impact on the project relative effort sometimes known as the 'productivity rate' and the measurement relative effort. Our research program is investigating the relationship between the attributes of requirements engineering (RE) outputs, the software process relative effort, and the measurement process relative effort. RE outputs studied are requirements and specifications documents and data models. As functional sizing is applied, thorough examination of RE outputs is done, which is likely to lead to identifying quality attributes and related findings. As a case study, this paper reports preliminary results related to the quality of requirements artefacts from a software development organization that is applying the Agile approach to its software development process. The functional size of the software developed through five projects was measured and compared with development effort and measurement effort, taking into account the quality rating of requirements. The results led to recommendations of improvement on the RE process that the organization could deploy in its current and next software projects. This paper also presents a list of functional sizing challenges that the measurer has faced, leading to proposed recommendations for planning any software measurement project.},

Based on the characteristics analysis of the plan in agile organization, we propose a four-layer framework, which supports a plan to bind action, actor and resource dynamically, as well as to improve the adaptability to the change of mission and environment by case-based and rule-based dynamically intelligent planning mechanism. In order to exchange information correctly and rapidly, information routing is introduced into this framework.

Thus, this framework can provide more flexibility for integration of heterogeneous planning systems and of planning systems and manufacturing execution system},

Method: In this paper, we present the focus group research pertaining to the agile ERP project context. We analyze the coordination requirements experiences of 9 practicing ERP consultants, specialized in agile ERP exclusively, for the purpose of understanding the fit of the 12 practices with these practitioners' project realities. Results/Conclusion: Our results suggest that all 12 practices have been observed by the practitioners. However, three out of the 12 practices were associated to levels of interorganizational coordination complexity which were different than what we thought.},

year={2012}, 
pages={1-8}, 
abstract={There is consensus in the research community that agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, are becoming more and more popular in delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile methodologies have not adequately modeled Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and their potential solutions (operationalizations) with FRs in early development phases-let alone having tools to support such initiatives. This research proposes NORMATIC, a Java-based simulation tool for modeling non-functional requirements for semi-automatic agile processes. NORMATIC is the semi-automatic tool that supports the more general Non-Functional Requirements Modeling for Agile Processes (NORMAP) Methodology. Early results show that the tool can potentially help agile software development teams in reasoning about and visually modeling NFRs as first-class artifacts early on during requirements gathering and analysis phases. The tool can also aid project managers and Scrum teams in user story estimate and risk calculations as well as risk-driven planning and visualization of the proposed plans.},

pages={157-162}, 
abstract={Merging agile with more traditional approaches in software development is a challenging task, especially when requirements are concerned: the main temptation is to let two opposite schools of thought become rigid in their own assumptions, without trying to recognize which advantages could come from either side. Mind mapping seems to provide a suitable solution for both parties: those who develop within an agile method and those who advocate proper requirements engineering practice. In this paper, mind mapping has been discussed as a suitable technique to elicit and represent requirements within the SCRUM model: specifically, we have focused on whether and how mind maps could lead to the development of a suitable product backlog, which in SCRUM plays the role of an initial requirements specification document. In order to experimentally assess how effectively practitioners could rely on a product backlog for their first development sprint, we have identified the adoption of mind maps as the independent variable and the quality of the backlog as the dependent variable, the latter being measured against the "function points" metric. Our hypothesis (i.e., mind maps are effective in increasing the quality of product backlogs) has been tested within an existing SCRUM project (the development of a digital library by an academic institution), and several promising data have been obtained and further discussed.},

pages={465-468}, 
abstract={The transformation of the American healthcare payment system from fee-for-service to value-based care increasingly makes it valuable to develop patient registries for specialized populations, to better assess healthcare quality and costs. Recent widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in the U.S. now makes possible construction of EHR-based specialty registry data collection tools and reports, previously unfeasible using manual chart abstraction. But the complexities of specialty registry EHR tools and measures, along with the variety of stakeholders involved, can result in misunderstood requirements and frequent product change requests, as users first experience the tools in their actual clinical workflows. Such requirements churn could easily stall progress in specialty registry rollout. Modeling a system's requirements and solution design can be a powerful way to remove ambiguities, facilitate shared understanding, and help evolve a design to meet newly-discovered needs. "Agile Modeling" retains these values while avoiding excessive unused up-front modeling in favor of iterative incremental modeling. Using Agile Modeling principles and practices, in calendar year 2015 one institution developed 58 EHR-based specialty registries, with 111 new data collection tools, supporting 134 clinical process and outcome measures, and enrolling over 16,000 patients. The subset of UML and non-UML models found most consistently useful in designing, building, and iteratively evolving EHR-based specialty registries included User Stories, Domain Models, Use Case Diagrams, Decision Trees, Graphical User Interface Storyboards, Use Case text descriptions, and Solution Class Diagrams.},

In this paper, we start with the hypothesis that performing informal verification of JIT requirements is useful. For this purpose we propose a framework for quality criteria for JIT requirements. This framework can be used by JIT teams to define 'just-enough' quality criteria. The framework also includes a time dimension such that quality criteria can be defined as 'just-in-time'. We demonstrate the application of this framework to feature requests in open source projects and explain how it could be customized for other JIT environments. We present our results for feature requests in open source projects, to show that there is a difference between creation-time quality and just-in-time quality. As this is ongoing research, we also list several points for discussion and future work.},

abstract={The development of high quality complex software systems and quick time-to-market with full customer satisfaction often appear as two competing forces. Many industry efforts have been directed towards agile methodologies completed with the DevOps approach, whereas traditional requirements engineering with much documentation, is considered surpassed. The aim is to obtain a longer life software because it suddenly responds to the customers changing requirements from which it receives continuous input. This might create a serious cost implication and a real risk to lose system requirements control. In this paper, we propose a framework able to govern the complexity of the system requirements and to allow the embedding, occasionally, of technological innovations into the overall system. ResDevOps joins the value of the agile world with DevOps, with the additional value deriving from an unceasing parallel innovation management process, which we call ResDevs. ResDevOps includes a continuous research and innovation process, which provides an asynchronous, additional input to the agile process inside a chain of concurrent engineering collaboration. This is a suitable trade-off to maintain modern IT Systems live for a longer time, with many consequent advantages for both total investment and system quality. The practical use of the ResDevOps approach is shown by means of a case study.},

Agile ideas and comprehensive documentation can be tried out, as well as the impact of prototypes and reviews on requirements. A player needs to balance speed and quality, and should weed out early misunderstandings later. This helps to experience advantages of systematic RE. The game facilitates comprehension and encourages taking RE a little more seriously.},
