 abstract = {Developing mobile applications is a challenging endeavor where technology and creativity are essential. Agile methodologies seem to be particularly adapted to the development of mobile applications; mobile applications have a limited scope and user interaction and time to market are particularly important. In this paper, we describe a study that evaluates the use of Scrum for software success in mobile application development. We defined an innovative model of working with Scrum in a class setting at Pace University involving a professional Scrum Master of the New York software industry and a real product owner. The mobile application that was developed targeted the growing mobile market in Africa. We explored the overall experience, adoption of Scrum and difficulties encountered by teams using Scrum for the first time. The paper reports on our findings and summarizes guidelines for instructors interested in replicating our work.}

 abstract = {Scrum has become one of the most popular agile methodologies, either alone or combined with other agile practices. Besides, CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is accepted as a suitable model to measure the maturity of the organizations when developing or acquiring software. Although these two approaches are often considered antagonist, the use of an agile approach to reach certain CMMI maturity levels may result beneficial to organizations that develop Web systems, since they would take the advantages of both approaches. In Web community, this union may be very interesting, because agile approaches fits with the special needs of Web development, and they could be a useful tool for companies getting a certain grade of maturity. This work analyzes the goals of CMMI maturity level 2 and the feasibility of achieving them using the practices proposed by Scrum, trying to assess whether the use of this methodology is suitable for meeting the CMMI generic and specific goals or not. Finally, and based on this analysis, this paper raises a possible extension of Scrum, based on agile techniques, to accommodate the CMMI maturity level 2.}

With the rising popularity of lightweight, agile methodologies, this becomes more complicated. This paper proposes a framework, FISA-XP, which can be adopted for the development of a secure software system. The proposed framework integrates security activities with the core activities of Extreme Programming based on their degree of agility. In order to calculate agility degree, some agility features are selected using a threshold value. The compatibility of the agile activities with security activities is subsequently assessed by introducing an integration matrix that describes whether integration of an agile activity with each security activity is possible or not. This framework assists in integrating security activities with agile activities, keeping the combined agility degree within acceptable limits. Thus, our approach introduces an Acceptable Agility Reduction Factor, which gives a threshold value for an acceptable reduction in agility degree. If reduction in combined agility degree is below the threshold value then that security activity is not accepted for integration. TISA-XP, an automated tool, has been designed to enable developers to use FISA-XP practically. This tool has been used by a software-developing company on an experimental basis and the feedback reflects its practical feasibility.}

However, most of these methodologies are centered on a development team and its internal communication. Moreover, for simplicity, a single product development is taken into account with its successive releases. There is another scenario: that of a single programmer working alone and often in much smaller projects and in several at the same time. Also in this scenario the client proximity is not as described by the agile environment ideal. In that case, the priorities and needs change, communication takes on another meaning and working mechanisms are not always comparable to that of a team. This paper introduces Faat (Freelance as a Team), a methodology specifically designed for those professionals. Integrating existing practices to the needs and possibilities of an individual programmer. However, it has been frequently considered the possible application of this methodology to small teams and/or other more general scenarios. This methodology has been tested in the web-based learning applications.}

New features and bug fixes were completed in a manner similar to a soccer game between two teams of five-year-olds, with everyone on the team chasing down the latest emergency. This paper discusses the agile software development discipline that enabled Sabrix to evolve from that chaotic environment to the point where the company was balancing both urgency and importance to drive product direction. This discipline enabled the company to actually deliver a "Release", and move forward into a new product architecture.}

In this paper we characterize the significance of software development models and the role of Agile methodologies in today's dynamic world of technologies. The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate the choice between two of the Agile methodologies, Scrum and Extreme Programming. The outcome of the investigation based on secondary sources and limited primary sources, reveals that current software industry practices tend to opt for Scrum-based development. This work highlights the benefits of bringing the cloud and Agile methods of software development together, to fully realize the potential of the distributed paradigm.}

The approach here presented has been used in the development process of a mobile application. So, we have proved it is possible to appropriately integrate usability evaluation techniques in agile methodologies, such as InterMod. Furthermore, improvements have been produced since early steps of the development process. On the one hand this integration promotes a development tailored to users' expectations; on the other hand it helps to plan the agile process of activities.}

The existing approaches to software maintenance, derived from the traditional approaches to development, are unable to resolve the problems of unstructured code, team morale, poor visibility of the project, lack of communication, and lack of proper test suites. Alternatively, extreme programming practices such as test driven development, refactoring, pair programming, continuous integration, small releases, and collective ownership help to resolve the aforesaid problems. In this paper, a process model is proposed for software maintenance using extreme programming practices to resolve maintenance issues in an improved manner. The proposed approach speeds up the maintenance process and produces more maintainable code with less effort for future maintenance and evolution. The proposed model is validated by applying it on several maintenance projects in an academic environment. It has been observed that the approach provides higher quality code. The proposed model based on extreme programming enhances both learning and productivity of the team by improving the morale, courage, and confidence of the team, which supports higher motivation during maintenance.}

A method comes with a set of best practices that are enforced and instantiated into processes to drive the realization steps of the development project. However, those best practices come in the form of text in guides and books, or they are in the developer's mind. Thus, during an instantiation of a method, there is no guaranty to enforce its best practices into the process, which could impact negatively the criteria: cost, time, and quality. To cope with this issue, we propose a library of best practices to be checked for four popular methods: Unified Process, Extreme Programming, Scrum and Kanban. On top of this library we have built up a template-based constraint language and implemented it to express additional constraints on processes that are modeled with UML Activity Diagrams (AD). To apply formal verification, we leverage on a formalization based on fUML semantics. The evaluation showed the feasibility of our approach which covers all the aspects of the process, i.e. time, resource, control-flow, and data-flow.}

As the work advances, it's common to notice requirement changes on simulation projects due to the participants getting more and better understanding about the scope.

The performance improvement comes from the removal of no-value activities and treatment of: (1) activities plan; (2) clearer communication between customer and developers; (3) precise scope agreement; and (4) schedule definition. This paper proposes the usage of Scrum on simulation projects, based on Project Management Body Of Knowledge, Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle and Agile methodology.

 abstract = {This paper looks at the Scrum software development process through a lens that emphasizes small worldness, nestedness, and scale-freeness, all characteristic of networks that feature weak links between their modules. Scrum has gained popularity over the past decade as a means of delivering valuable software to its host organization on a regular basis. Since weak links characterize natural and social systems at every scale, practitioners of Scrum should be able to improve their teams' processes by applying lessons learned from studying weak links. When practitioners look for weak links directly, they may find the task daunting and ask the question: "How can I tell whether weak links are strengthening or weakening my team's Scrum process if I can't even find them?" For the answer, this paper looks to Christopher Alexander's characteristics of wholeness, integrity, or life -- strong centers, levels of scale, echoes, alternating repetition, and, in particular, the characteristic called deep interlock and ambiguity -- which may correlate with the presence of weak links.}

These changes are particularly related to software testing perspectives. Apart from that, I will share the challenges that have been faced and how we have managed them since the organization fully adopted Agile Scrum within the first 18 months.

This approach allows the automatic determination of the optimal set of tasks for a given sprint, as well as its execution flow, considering the a priori information concerning the current state of the project, tasks's difficulty and importance, and the relations between tasks. The proposed solution is based on the representation of the project decision space, defined by this information, as workflow models. To evaluate the approach, a prototype has been developed and is being assessed in the context of the Cornea Notification and Collecting Information System (Sincap) project. The results suggest that the use of the approach provides greater determinism for the sprint planning process, easies the viewing and evaluation of project scenarios and decreases planning time.}

Pair Programming leads to a large increase in the personnel cost, and Test-Driven Development adds to the development effort. On the other hand, pp can speed the project up, both pp and Tdd can reduce the defect density of the code. Can the increased cost of XP be balanced by its shorter time to market and higher code quality? To answer this question, we construct a new model for the business value of software projects. We then analyze the cost and benefit of XP by applying our model to a realistic sample project. We systematically vary important model parameters to provide a sensitivity analysis. Our analysis shows that the economic value of, XP strongly depends on how large the XP speed and defect advantage really are. We also find that the market pressure is an important factor when assessing the business value of XP., Our study provides clear guidelines for managers when to consider using XP -- or better not.}

We extract common attributes and properties out of Agile Methodologies to establish a common Agile Software Development Model (ASDM). To build our model we take a look at the Agile Manifesto as well as eXtreme Programing (XP) and Scrum, and also a project-specific Agile Methodology called I2. We describe the Agile Software Development Methodologies in terms of Sets, Relations and Equations to make similarities and differences visible. With this formal characterization we can compare the Methodologies to each other and extract the common attributes and properties as parts of the common Agile Software Development Model (ASDM). After establishing our model we assess the explanatory power and aspects of completeness of the model to identify weakness and improvement potential. The explanatory power means the ability to characterize a Methodology and compare different Methodologies to each other. Completeness issues are related to the model itself, to the model's instantiations (e. g. describing XP with the ASDM) and the completeness of (relevant) Practices. Using this approach we try to achieve better theoretical understanding and comparability for Agile Methodologies.}

Promoted by senior software practitioners, agile methods were intended to avoid traditional engineering practices and rather focus on delivering working software as quickly as possible. Thus, the unique measure in Scrum, a well known framework for managing agile projects, is velocity. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the progress in delivering working software. In software engineering (SE), measurement programs have more in depth purposes and allow teams and individuals to improve their development process along with providing better product quality and control over the project. This paper will describe the experience and the approach used in an agile SE company to design and initiate a measurement program taking into account the specificities of their agile environment, principles and values. The lessons learned after five months of investigation are twofold. The first one shows how agile teams, in comparison to traditional teams, have different needs when trying to establish a measurement program. The second confirms that agile teams, as many other groups of workers, are reluctant and resistant to change. Finally, the preliminary results show that agile people are more interested in value delivery, technical debt, and multiple aspects related to team dynamics and will cooperate to the collection of data as soon as there tools can do it for them. It is believed that this research could suggest new guidelines for elaborating specific measurement programs in other agile environments.}

In this paper, we describe a case study performed at Sabre Airline Solutions evaluating the effects of adopting Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study. We also identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial case studies: availability of data, tool support, co-operative personnel and project status. We believe that recognizing and planning for these factors is essential to conducting industrial case studies, and that this information will be helpful to researchers and practitioners alike.}

We define aspects to support both software process management and software process modeling. As we show, the aspects can monitor, enforce, or even partially implement compliance with desired development practices. They also provide a basis for a precise description of a software development process. As a case-study, we consider Extreme Programming (XP) and the Eclipse platform. XP is a software development methodology described by underlying values, principles and practices. We present examples of AspectJ aspects that support XP guidelines such as "compose tests before coding" or "provide rapid feedback". Their abstract definitions are shown to be platform independent and correspond to the XP ontology. Their concrete implementation and weaving is connected to Eclipse, an open-source development environment. The design and a prototype implementation of aspects for XP over Eclipse is described.}

The design space for such courses is wide, ranging from single-semester to two-semester courses, from single-client to multicustomer courses, from local to globally distributed courses, and from toy projects to projects with real clients. The challenge for a nontrivial project course is how to make the project complex enough to enrich students software engineering experience, yet realistic enough to have a teaching environment that does not unduly burden students or the instructor. We describe a methodology for project courses that is realizable for instructors, improves students skills, and leads to viable results for industry partners. In particular, recent advances in release management and collaboration workflows reduce the effort of students and instructors during delivery and increase the quality of the deliverables. To enable release and feedback management, we introduce Rugby, an agile process model based on Scrum that allows reacting to changing requirements. To improve early communication, we use Tornado, a scenario-based design approach that emphasizes the use of informal models for the interaction between clients and students. The combination of Rugby and Tornado allows students to deal with changing requirements, produce multiple releases, and obtain client feedback through the duration of the course. We describe our experience with more than 300 students working on 40 projects with external clients over a 4-year period. In the latest instance of our course, the students have produced more than 7000 builds with 600 releases for eleven clients. In an evaluation of the courses, we found that the introduction of Rugby and Tornado significantly increased students technical skills, especially with respect to software engineering, usability engineering, and configuration management, as well as their nontechnical skills such as communication with the client, teamwork, presentation, and demo management. Finally, we discuss how other instructors can adapt the course concept.}

Objectives: The aim of this study is to provide a detailed overview of the state of the art in the area of effort estimation in ASD. Method: To report the state of the art, we conducted a systematic literature review in accordance with the guidelines proposed in the evidence-based software engineering literature. Results: A total of 25 primary studies were selected; the main findings are: i) Subjective estimation techniques (e.g. expert judgment, planning poker, use case points estimation method) are the most frequently applied in an agile context; ii) Use case points and story points are the most frequently used size metrics respectively; iii) MMRE (Mean Magnitude of Relative Error) and MRE (Magnitude of Relative Error) are the most frequently used accuracy metrics; iv) team skills, prior experience and task size are cited as the three important cost drivers for effort estimation in ASD; and v) Extreme Programming (XP) and SCRUM are the only two agile methods that are identified in the primary studies. Conclusion: Subjective estimation techniques, e.g. expert judgment-based techniques, planning poker or the use case points method, are the one used the most in agile effort estimation studies. As for the size metrics, the ones that were used the most in the primary studies were story points and use case points. Several research gaps were identified, relating to the agile methods, size metrics and cost drivers, thus suggesting numerous possible avenues for future work.}

 abstract = {Traditional heavyweight software development methodologies are rigid, heavily documentation oriented and process oriented. In the present E-Business dominated environment, the above methodologies are hard to follow. In response to this, a new generation of lightweight methodologies such as Extreme Programming (XP) has evolved which has only a few simple rules to adopt, and insist on less documentation. XP proposes four values, a development process and twelve practices. One of the significant benefits among those claimed by the inventors of XP is the reduction of effort in the software development. However, the extent of fulfillment of this claim remains unanswered by empirical and quantitative evidences. Hence, the effects of XP on software development effort are to be investigated. In this study, we developed a process simulation model to analyze the effects of individual XP practices on development effort. System dynamics based simulation, an effective modeling technique for software development process was chosen. This model has accounted for all the twelve practices and processes of XP. We have also introduced a measurement scale for measuring the level of usage of individual XP practices. The factors that affect the cost are collected from literature and a few XP project managers. The process model was simulated for a case study of a typical XP project to investigate the effects of individual XP practices on development effort by varying their usage levels. The decrease in percentage of the development effort for each XP practice when its usage level is varied from minimum to maximum during which all the other practices were maintained at a constant usage level was found. The decrease in percentage of the development effort for each XP practice when its usage level is minimum and maximum was computed and is given below. (i) Planning game - 2.67% (ii) Small Release - 2.67% (iii) Metaphor - 2.01% (iv) Simple design - 2.5% (v) Continuous Testing - 2.88% (vi) Refactoring -0.677% (vii) On-site Customer - 5.48% (viii) Pair programming - 4.4% (ix) Collective Code Ownership -- 4.82% (x) Forty Hours Per Week - 2% (xi) Coding Standard - 4.82% (xii) Continuous Integration - 1.13%. The finding of the present study on the effects of individual XP practices depicts a reduction in software development effort by enhancing their usage levels.}

Existing approaches of software maintenance estimation such as ACT, FP and COCOMO 2.0 reuse model are based on traditional methods of software development. Software Maintenance Effort Estimation Model (SMEEM) is an estimation method that incorporates various value adjustment factors affecting the estimation of the maintenance project [2]. The SMEEM model generates the more realistic and precise estimation results for agile and extreme programming based maintenance environment. The SMEEM Model calculates and adjusts size of maintenance effort but it is unable to estimate phase wise effort, which is crucial to determine the accurate estimates. In this paper, effort estimation technique is proposed for maintenance project that estimates phase wise effort. This technique employs empirical data from industry practitioners and PG students for phase effort estimation. The proposed technique is illustrated and validated using a case study in subsequent section. It provides more realistic result as compare to the existing techniques on maintenance effort estimation and helpful in estimating phase wise maintenance effort in extreme programming based maintenance environment.}

In particular, we use Event-B and Scrum to assure the quality and more rapid and flexible development. Since we identified that there are more prerequisites for a successful IT project, we use DevOps to embrace the development, quality assurance and IT operations.

Such changes made it possible to develop applications focusing on refactoring rather than on analysis and design. The underlying hypothesis is that by adopting suitable tools and target languages, refactoring would possibly cost less than the overhead introduced by modern A&amp;D techniques. Recently, extreme programming has been proposed as an alternative to a "design-oriented" life-cycle.In this paper we describe a software application developed using a software life-cycle that basically follows the guidelines suggested by extreme programming. Such an approach requires highly expressive programming languages and powerful CASE tools. UML has been selected as the underlying modeling language throughout the whole process, for it incorporates well-known diagrams for describing a software application from different perspectives. Smalltalk has been selected as target language, as it allows fast prototyping and early delivery. We claim that, for small and medium-sized projects, a life-cycle based on refactoring and supported by suitable languages and tools allows team productivity to be greatly enhanced.}

However, due to a lack of safety assurance activities, agile methods are criticized for being inadequate for the development of safe software. Safety analysis and safety verification are complementary methods for safety assurance. Yet, both usually rely on traditional, waterfall-like processes. Therefore, it is strongly needed to integrate an appropriate safety analysis approach into agile software development processes driving architecture design and verify the safe design at the code level. This paper presents a novel agile process model "S-Scrum" based on the existing development process "Safe Scrum" and extended by a safety analysis method and a safety verification approach based on STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis). The proposed agile development process S-Scrum can be separated into three parts: (1) performing safety-guided design by STPA inside each sprint. (2) Verifying safety requirements at the code level by using model checking. (3) Replacing traditional RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety) validation on the final product by STPA safety analysis. We adopt other aspects from the original Safe Scrum. Finally, the feasibility of S-Scrum is illustrated with the example of an airbag system.}

The theme of this paper is to address the relationship between agile methods and architectural modelling and to propose a novel process for agile architectural modelling, which drives requirements elicitation through the use of patterns and components. This process is in-line with agile principles and is illustrated on an example application.

But how well do current scientific software development processes match the practices found in agile development methods, and what are the effects of using agile practices in such processes? In order to investigate this, we conduct a literature review, focusing on evaluating the agility present in a selection of scientific software projects. Both projects with intentionally agile practices and projects with a certain degree of agile elements are taken into consideration. In the agility assessment, we define and utilize an agile mapping chart. The elements of the mapping chart are based on Scrum and XP, thus covering two of the most prominent agile reference models. We compared the findings of the literature review to results of a previously conducted survey. The comparison indicates that scientific software development projects adopting agile practices perceive their testing to be better than average. No difference to average projects was perceived regarding requirements-related activities. Future work includes an in-depth case study to further investigate the existence and impact of agility in three large scientific software projects, ultimately aiming at a better understanding of the particularities involved in developing scientific software.}

For example, one may expect that the combination of autonomous teams and the necessity for an overall organizational control structure may lead to conflicts, and one may expect that Agile's informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down as the number of project participants increases. Such issues may in turn compromise the project's productivity. In order to better understand potential threats to productivity in large agile development projects, we conducted repertory grid interviews with 13 project members on their perceptions of threats to productivity. The project was a large software development project consisting of 11 Scrum teams from three different subcontractors. The repertory grid sessions produced 100 issues, which were content analyzed into 10 main problem areas: (1) Restraints on collaboration due to contracts, ownership, and culture, (2) Architectural and technical qualities are given low priority, (3) Conflicts between organizational control and flexibility, (4) Volatile and late requirements from external parties, (5) Lack of a shared vision for the end product, (6) Limited dissemination of functional knowledge, (7) Excessive dependencies within the system, (8) Overloading of key personnel, (9) Difficulties in maintaining well-functioning technical environments, (10) Difficulties in coordinating test and deployment with external parties. Using critical-case reasoning, we claim that projects deploying agile practices in projects with less favorable conditions than those enjoyed in the current project, and that are larger and more complex, are likely to face similar challenges.}

The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes. This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.}

 abstract = {We've have been proposing formal mathematical methods of software development for nearly as long as we've been developing software. CASE tools were a bust, and Gödel long ago nullified any hope of building a system that is both complete and consistent. Model-driven development gets trotted out in a new outfit once every decade as the next "silver bullet," but we're still far from drawing pictures that generate code. Test-driven development almost produces executable specifications, but there's nothing mathematical or provably correct about them. Quality assurance happens during coding, but there's nothing to ensure that the entire system gets built, or that it's what the customer wants. Agile methods propose "emergent design," where BDUF (big design up front) is old-fashioned and limiting. But agile methods work best with small groups of clever people to implement them; they have a hard time scaling. The open-source movement, in which hobbyist programmers write code simply for the love of programming, has produced some of the best software in the industry. Is it good because people love what they're doing and build it for themselves to use? Or is it good because there are hundreds of eyes on the code? Is software development a science or an art? Does it depend on mathematicians or on craftspeople? Are these viewpoints reconcilable?}

 abstract = {In any software development life cycle, requirement and software changes are inevitable. One of the factors that influences the effectiveness of the change acceptance decision is the accuracy of the effort prediction for requirement changes. There are two current models that have been widely used to predict rework effort for requirement changes which are algorithmic and non-algorithmic models. The algorithmic model is known for its formal and structural way of prediction and best suited for Traditional software development methodology. While non-algorithmic model is widely adopted for Agile software development methodology of software projects due to its easiness and requires less work in term of effort predictability. Nevertheless, none of the existing effort prediction models for requirement changes are proven to suit both, Traditional and Agile software development methodology. Thus, this paper proposes an algorithmic-based effort prediction model for requirement changes that uses change impact analysis method which is applicable for both Traditional and Agile software development methodologies. The proposed model uses a current selected change impact analysis method for software development phase. The proposed model is evaluated through an extensive experimental validation using case study of six real Traditional and Agile methodologies software projects. The evaluation results confirmed a significance accuracy improvement of the proposed model over the existing approaches for both Traditional and Agile methodologies.}

Early use of these techniques can also increase the sense of belonging for students and can lead to the early development of collaborative skills to prepare students for team experiences in subsequent courses and future careers. During the weekly lab sessions of a second semester introduction to programming course students engaged in collaborative learning experiences through team-based problem solving, project planning, pair programming, and other agile software development practices. Course objectives provided specific goals and criteria for assessment relative to these skills. The assessment in the authors' prior work identified several problem areas which led to specific initiatives to address those problems: (a) instructor-chosen teams, (b) early instruction and reflection on team skills, (c) feedback on team performance, and (d) the use of an IDE that incorporates an automated test-driven development tool. This paper describes the implementation and assessment of these efforts. A significant increase in student team skills from the middle of the semester to the end of the semester was observed.}

To facilitate a rational and efficient planning process, release planning models make such factors explicit and compute release plan alternatives according to optimization principles. However, experience suggests that industrial use of such models is limited. To investigate the feasibility of model and tool support, we compared input factors assumed by release planning models with factors considered by expert planners. The former factors were cataloged by systematically surveying release planning models, while the latter were elicited through repertory grid interviews in three software organizations. The findings indicate a substantial overlap between the two approaches. However, a detailed analysis reveals that models focus on only select parts of a possibly larger space of relevant planning factors. Three concrete areas of mismatch were identified: (1) continuously evolving requirements and specifications, (2) continuously changing prioritization criteria, and (3) authority-based decision processes. With these results in mind, models, tools and guidelines can be adjusted to address better real-life development processes.}

Among the impacts found, an individuals perceived level of control within the interaction emerged as significant. We describe the specific behaviors which shape an individuals perceived control, and thus motivation, in our context, and investigate the underlying causes for these behaviors by assessing them in accordance with extant social-psychological theory. We find that the very nature of XP itself imparts strong psychological pressures on participants which can positively affect their interactions, and thus, motivation. However, these pressures also contribute to de-motivation in our context, when their effects on customer-developer interactions are not appropriately monitored and mitigated.}

Researchers and practitioners alike have argued that numerous benefits could be garnered from adopting a feature-driven development approach. However, those persuasive arguments have not been matched with supporting empirical evidence. Moreover, developing software systems around features involves new technical and organizational elements that could have significant implications for outcomes such as software quality. This paper presents an empirical analysis of a large-scale project that implemented 1195 features in a software system. We examined the impact that technical attributes of product features, attributes of the feature teams and crossfeature interactions have on software integration failures. Our results show that technical factors such as the nature of component dependencies and organizational factors such as the geographic dispersion of the feature teams and the role of the feature owners had complementary impact suggesting their independent and important role in terms of software quality. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that cross-feature interactions, measured as the number of architectural dependencies between two product features, are a major driver of integration failures. The research and practical implications of our results are discussed.}

Support for such workflow in machine learning applications remains primitive. The platform developed at if(we) embodies a specific machine learning approach and a rigorous data architecture constraint, so allowing teams to work in rapid iterative cycles. We require models to consume data from a time-ordered event history, and we focus on facilitating creative feature engineering. We make it practical for data scientists to use the same model code in development and in production deployment, and make it practical for them to collaborate on complex models. We deliver real-time recommendations at scale, returning top results from among 10,000,000 candidates with sub-second response times and incorporating new updates in just a few seconds. Using the approach and architecture described here, our team can routinely go from ideas for new models to production-validated results within two weeks.}

The game integrates novel accessibility features to make it usable by seniors. Several indexes of evaluation are registered while users perform the test, that provide a complete picture of the user's behavior during the game. The design and implementation of the game has been realized following a user-centered agile methodology that has allowed to refine the tasks and enhance the technology throughout the development stage. The game is currently in a validation stage on a sample of 1000 users. The results of the electronic test are been compared to standard pen-based tests. We except that the validation will confirm SmartAgeing as a powerful screening tool for the early detection of cognitive impairments on a wide scale, otherwise impossible using the traditional pen-based test.}

Given life cycle approach and practices will be useful for any software project. In particular, these practices will be significant to any legacy project towards repaying debt. These methods can also be applied to continuously improve code quality and product quality. This paper also focus on technical debt user stories to gain business buy-in and share few 'best in market' tools that we used in repaying technical debt. It also focuses on sensitizing developers to the concept of debt and improving their skills.

The second is an agile yet highly disciplined approach to designing, testing, implementing, and verifying our software which presumes all bugs are unacceptable and must be found and fixed early before they impact internal groups, external partners, and eventually our customers.

This paper presents an agile transformation experience that has been undertaken in a public organisation in Belgium and during which Scrum was applied in two pilot projects. The first project retrospective shows that the change cannot be accomplished only at the team-level without taking into account the overall structure of the organisation and that we must carefully evolve toward a context-specific adapted method. In the second pilot project, we defined structured and repeatable steps to assist the adoption of agile practices. The experience shows the usefulness of such an approach but suggests that automation efforts should be addressed.   The last section of the paper summarizes the issues encountered and presents the AM-QuICK framework which aims at providing a supported approach to guide the agile adoption, adaptation and assessment.}

Moreover, SPLASH 2013 is proud to host the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE), co-locating with the International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE). SPLASH this year revives the former educator's symposium in its new guise as SPLASH-E, for discussion of Computer Science education uniquely embedded within the culture of visionary research and practice embodied by OOPSLA, Onward!, and Wavefront. SPLASH-E is timely in that it coincides with the finalization of the ACM/IEEE Computer Science Curriculum 2013. This year also sees the return to SPLASH of tutorials and tech-talks, plus a new twist in the form of the synergistic SPLASH-I as a forum for acclaimed speakers from industry, all offered free to SPLASH attendees. Drawing on the long tradition of OOPSLA, and with the addition of Onward! and Wavefront, SPLASH embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery to make it the premier conference at the intersection of programming, languages, and software engineering. OOPSLA was the incubator for CRC cards, CLOS, design patterns, Self, the agile methodologies, serviceoriented architectures, wikis, Unified Modeling Language (UML), test driven design (TDD), refactoring, Java, dynamic compilation, and aspect-oriented programming, just to name a few. Onward! focuses on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to not yet well-proven but well-argued ideas. Wavefront is about how industry applies the lessons learned from the software development community in deploying today's software and systems, and how the community can learn from what is happening in the trenches of software engineering. The Dynamic Languages Symposium is the place where researchers and practitioners come together to discuss the new crop of wildly successful dynamic languages, their implementation, and their applications. Guest conferences at SPLASH this year include GPCE and SLE. The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software products. The International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to topics related to artificial languages in software engineering. SLE's mission is to encourage and organize communication among communities that have traditionally looked at software languages from different and yet complementary perspectives. This year we are extremely fortunate to have four keynote speakers who tap into broad and deep SPLASH themes. Kathryn McKinley looks at the impact that heterogeneous hardware is having on the design and implementation of software abstractions for parallelism. Greg Wilson asks why the gap between research and practice remains so wide, and suggests how to narrow it. Molham Aref explores declarative programming for the cloud to combine rapid prototyping with performance in the deployment of large-scale cloud applications. Gilad Bracha ponders the history of innovation in programming languages and what is yet to come, asking how the elegance of Lisp, Simula, Actors, Beta, Smalltalk and Self led to the reality of C++, Java, Javascript, Perl, Python and PHP.}

We have therefore looked at three known Security Engineering processes, Microsoft SDL, Cigatel touchpoints and Common Criteria and identified what specific security activities they performed. We then compared these activities with an Agile development process that is used in industry. Developers, from a large telecommunication manufacturer, were interviewed to learn their impressions on using these security activities in an agile development process. We produced a security enhanced Agile development process that we present in this paper. This new Agile process use activities from already established security engineering processes that provide the benefit the developers wanted but did not hinder or obstruct the Agile process in a significant way.}

 abstract = {The development of electronic commerce (EC) systems is subject to different conditions than that of conventional software systems. Consequently, software development processes used for conventional systems to date need to be adapted to these new conditions. This includes the introduction of new activities to the development process and the removal of others. In addition, the roles involved in the development process, their tasks, qualifications and the software tools used by them, are different to other processes. An adapted process must cope with important idiosyncrasies of EC system development: EC systems typically have a high degree of interaction, which makes factors like ergonomics, didactics and psychology especially important in the development of user interfaces. Typically, they also have a high degree of integration with existing software systems such as legacy or groupware systems. Integration techniques have to be selected systematically in order not to endanger the whole software development process. Furthermore, the approach to the development of EC systems should take into account the "time-to-market" factor and allow development time reduction while retaining quality. This paper introduces and describes an adapted software development process for EC systems and its special features using the development of an EC portal system as an example.}

Investigating process conformance during training and understanding if programmers are able and willing to follow the specific steps are crucial to evaluating whether the process improves various software product quality factors. In this paper we present a process model independent approach to detect process non-conformance. Our approach is based on non-intrusively collected data captured by a version control system and provides the project manager with timely updates. Further, we provide evidence of the applicability of our approach by investigating process conformance in a five day training class on eXtreme Programming (XP) practices at the Leibniz Universität Hannover. Our results show that the approach enabled researchers to formulate minimal intrusive methods to check for conformance and that for the majority of the investigated XP practices violations could be detected.}

A current issue is the verification and validation of proposed methods for technical debt management in the context of agile development. In practice, such evaluations are either too costly or too time consuming to be conducted using traditional empirical methods. In this paper, we describe a set of simulations based on models of the agile development process, Scrum, and the integration of technical debt management. The purpose of this study is to identify which strategy is superior and to provide empirical evidence to support existing claims. The models presented are based upon conceptual and industry models concerning defects and technical debt. The results of the simulations provide compelling evidence for current technical debt management strategies proposed in the literature that can be immediately applied by practitioners.}

 abstract = {Every day increases the level of demand by customers in regard to the quality and complexity of software systems. Because of this, companies are increasingly customizing their software processes according to market and project needs. A systematic way is the use of the Software Process Line strategy (SPrL), in which each product derived from the line is a specific software process. Therefore, variability management is an essential activity. This paper presents an empirical study comparing the compositional and the annotative approaches in representing variability in SPrLs taking into consideration a SCRUM-based SPrL. Eclipse Process Framework was chosen to represent the compositional approach, whereas SMartySPEM was considered to the annotative approach. The approaches were compared taking into account the sequential exploratory strategy based on mixed-methods. A qualitative empirical study comparing these approaches was planned, executed and previously published with relation to the following set of criteria: modularity, traceability, error detection, granularity and systematic management of variability. Such study was based on the expertise of software process experts and provided important information for the hypothesis formulation about systematic management of variability, the main dependent variable of this quantitative study. Thus, the quantitative study presented in this paper analyzes the effectiveness of variability representation. As the main contribution of this paper, we present preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of variability management, allowing supporting the gathering of solid evidence for further research in academic and industrial set about the compositional and annotative approaches for variability management in SPrLs. As a result of this quantitative empirical study it was not statistically possible to confirm that the annotative approach is more effective than the compositional approach.}

In fact, plenty of process models have already been proposed to bridge the gap between User-Centered Development and Information Architecture, empowering the development team to build usable applications successfully. However, the combination of User-Centered Development and Information Architecture paradigms sometimes results in cumbersome process models containing lots of phases and activities to be considered, which increases the cycle time to have partial and validated software increments readily. As less effort has been devoted to speed up the usable Information Architecture development, the aim of this paper is to address such problem. To do so, we present Scrum-UIA, an agile and usable development process driven by the Information Architecture. This process is intended to develop web applications by splitting up responsibilities and tasks, and decreasing the time to perform technical activities, in order to readily obtain usable software increments.}

This often results in documentation that is less than satisfactory in terms of quality, relevance, and longevity of information to developers who will be responsible for subsequent enhancements to the product. This paper outlines an approach to producing effective program documentation by connecting technical communicators and technical developers in a pair-wise manner. This approach is modeled on the development methodology advocated by eXtreme Programming (XP). Programmers who adopt XP work in pairs, and thus are in constant communication with one another. By pairing a technical communicator with a technical developer, many of the same benefits can be gained. Rather than eschewing program documentation, the paired communicator and developer instead produce high-quality documentation during the development process, with little extra effort, resulting in a more maintainable software application. The paper also describes some recent experiences in pairing a senior person and a junior person in communicator and developer roles to enhance program documentation of a long-lived and popular research application.}

Based on the Next Generation Teaching Education and Learning for Life (NEXT-TELL) European Commission integrated project, we envision classrooms of the 21st century to (a) incorporate 1:1 computing, (b) provide computational as well as methodological support for teachers to design, deploy and assess learning activities and (c) immerse students in rich, personalized and varied learning activities in information ecologies resulting in high-performance, high-density, high-bandwidth, and data-rich classrooms. In contrast to existing research in educational data mining and learning analytics, our vision is to employ visual analytics techniques and tools to support teachers dynamic diagnostic pedagogical decision-making in real-time and in actual classrooms. The primary benefits of our vision is that learning analytics becomes an integral part of the teaching profession so that teachers can provide timely, meaningful, and actionable formative assessments to on-going learning activities in-situ. Integrating emerging developments in visual analytics and the established methodological approach of design-based research (DBR) in the learning sciences, we introduce a new method called "Teaching Analytics" and explore a triadic model of teaching analytics (TMTA). TMTA adapts and extends the Pair Analytics method in visual analytics which in turn was inspired by the pair programming model of the extreme programming paradigm. Our preliminary vision of TMTA consists of a collocated collaborative triad of a Teaching Expert (TE), a Visual Analytics Expert (VAE), and a Design-Based Research Expert (DBRE) analyzing, interpreting and acting upon real-time data being generated by students' learning activities by using a range of visual analytics tools. We propose an implementation of TMTA using open learner models (OLM) and conclude with an outline of future work}

 abstract = {Interest in the use of processes to provide assistance in software development activities remains at a high level. But the focus of attention has shifted in recent years. Early work emphasizing the study of languages for defining processes was rapidly eclipsed by process evaluation and improvement work, most notably the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). As process improvement has matured as a strategy and philosophy it has also given rise to a strong reaction to the perception that it is unduly ponderous and constraining. Movements such as Extreme Programming (XP) have cast themselves as lightweight alternatives, emphasizing the primacy of freedom and flexibility. Both philosophies and communities continue to grow in size, development, and depth of understanding.The goal of this panel will be to explore the differences between these major approaches to the use of process in software development by bringing together leading articulate exponents of the approaches. Each panelist will be charged with presenting a very concise characterization of the approach being represented. But the focus of the panel will be on understanding the nature of the differences in approach, and the reasons for these differences. Similarities will be sought as well.An underlying hypothesis of the panel is that the differences in approach arise in large measure from differences in objective and differences in assumptions about the software development context. Thus, for example, one approach may be intended to support very long range organizational objectives, while the other may be more tactically oriented. One approach may assume that evolvability is an overriding objective, while another may be more focused on speed to market. One may make stronger assumptions about the skills and training of project personnel. The panel will attempt to delve into these issues to see if it may be possible to suggest criteria for suggesting which approach (and possible adaptation) should be selected for a given development situation.In a larger sense, the goal of this panel is to suggest the possibility of a discipline of software process engineering. Insofar as the panel is able to suggest that development situations can be used to guide the selection of process approaches to the provision of assistance, might this then be an indication that process formalisms could play a role in subsequent specification of detailed processes, and evaluation of their effectiveness?The panel will react to this and related questions. While lively interchanges among the panelists will be stimulated and expected, similar interchanges with the audience will also be cultivated.}

 abstract = {This volume contains the proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Refactoring Tools (WRT 2011), held in conjunction with the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2011). This workshop is a continuation of a series of previous workshops (ECOOP 2007, OOPSLA 2008 and 2009, http://refactoring.info/WRT) where researchers and developers of refactoring tools can meet and discuss recent ideas and work, and view tool demonstrations. Refactoring is the process of applying behavior-preserving transformations to a program with the objective of improving the program's design. A specific refactoring is identified by a name (e.g., Extract Method), a set of preconditions, and a set of transformations that need to be performed. Tool support for refactoring is essential because checking the preconditions of refactoring often requires nontrivial program analysis, and applying transformations may affect many locations throughout a program. In recent years, the emergence of lightweight programming methodologies such as Extreme Programming has generated a great amount of interest in refactoring, and refactoring support has become a required feature in today's IDEs. While there is a great deal of interest in developing tool support for refactoring, researchers and tool vendors rarely work together. This forum fosters the transfer of ideas and expertise both ways: researchers can show the state-of-the-art analyses they are using in developing tool support for refactoring, tool vendors can offer valuable insights onthe challenges of scaling such analyses to realistic applications. By bringing together researchers and tool vendors, we can shorten the time to transfer ideas into production systems. In addition, by making researchers aware of what others are working on, the potential for reinventing the wheel is reduced and the potential for creative collaboration is enhanced. This year, we received 15 submissions of which 8 were accepted. We would like to thank the authors for submitting their work. We are extremely grateful to the Program Committee members who did an outstanding job at reviewing the submissions and providing constructive feedback on how the authors can further improve their work. We feel that the quality of the reviews rivals that of the larger conferences. We thank Bill Griswold, Sebastian Elbaum, and Kathryn Stolee for their keynotes. Also, we thank the ICSE workshop chairs, Matthew Dwyer and Wolgang Emmerich, for their dedication to a great workshop experience at ICSE.}
