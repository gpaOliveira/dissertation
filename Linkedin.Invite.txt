Hi Luda,

Have you been practicing BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) lately? Do you believe scenarios' quality matter?

I'm writing my graduate thesis on that subject and would like to invite you to talk about it for 1 hour during the week. Would that be possible?

Best regards

Hi Hema,

During your time practicing BDD, have you seen the quality of written scenarios impact the team somehow?

I'm writing my graduate thesis on that subject and would like to invite you to talk about it for 1 hour during the week. Would that be possible?

Best regards

Hi Jasper,

I've seen your interest into BDD and realized I could use your help :slight_smile:
 
Do you believe BDD written scenarios quality matter?

I'm writing my graduate thesis on that subject and would like to invite you to talk about it for 1 hour during the week (or the weekend - I'm very eager to hear your thoughts :smiley:) . 

Would that be possible?
