Have you been practicing BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) lately and believe scenarios' quality matter?

I'm writing my graduate thesis on that subject and would like to invite you all to answer a (really) small 2 questions survey about the subject in here: https://goo.gl/forms/dheA8XK0asiNUVze2

If you're willing to spend a little more time to talk to me about that subject, please remember to fill out your contact information there - or comment on this topic here - and I will promptly get in touch :) !
